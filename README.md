Java Awezomg
============

Java was invented during the war. As such it's still unsure about all these web whippersnappers and their do-hickies.

...and like a well built tractor, Java is stable and mature. There is no reason why your project has to look like one.

java-awezomg is here to help bring the old Java tools up to date. No more framesets for javadocs, no more fiddling to find the maven site button.

Heavily inspired by html5boilerplate.com and domainszomg.com
